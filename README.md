# Auto-ML: Automated Machine Learning

Welcome to the Auto-ML project repository!

## Introduction

Auto-ML is an innovative application that enables users to perform automated machine learning tasks without the need for coding or prior machine learning expertise. It offers a user-friendly interface to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), train various classic machine learning models with hyperparameter tuning, and deploy models for real-time interaction.

## Features

- **No-Code ML**: Perform EDA, train models, and deploy them with no coding required.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: An intuitive interface makes it easy to navigate and interact with the application.
- **Data Upload**: Users can effortlessly upload CSV files for analysis and model training.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Gain insights and visualize data through interactive EDA tools.
- **Model Training and Hyperparameter Tuning**: Train and fine-tune different machine learning models using the power of SKlearn.
- **Real-Time Model Deployment**: Deploy trained models for real-time interaction on the user-friendly interface.
- **Upcoming Features**: Connect Local Linear Models (LLM) for further data insights, automate hyperparameter tuning, and enjoy enhanced model exporting options.
